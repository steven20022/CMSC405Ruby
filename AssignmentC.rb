# 1. Write the lines of code that use a block-form while loop to compute
# the power of a number. The power of a number tells you how 
# many times to use the number in a multiplication statement; for example,
# 2 to the 0 power is 1
# 2 to the 1st power is 2 
# 2 to the 2nd power is 2 * 2 
# 2 to the 3rd power is 2 * 2 * 2
# 2 to the 4th power is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2
# 2 to the 5th power is 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2

# 2. Write a function named gen_power that computes and returns
# the power of a number. It must have two integer input parameters; 
# the first must contain the number and the second must contain the power.

# 3. Write the code to call the gen_power function and output the 
# return from the function.

# 4. Write a function named gen_power that returns a code block. The code
# block should compute and return the power of a number. The code block
# must have two integer input parameters; the first must contain the number 
# and the second must contain the power.

# 5. Write the code to call the gen_power function and store the code 
# block it returns in a variable named p.

# 6. Write the code to execute the code block contained in p 
# and output the code block's return.

# 7. Explain how you interacted with the Ruby programming language? Your
# response to this question must be at least 1 full paragraph (50 words).
# 8. Which Ruby module provides a whole set of I/O related methods?
# 9. What is Ruby's typing model?
# 10. What syntax must you use to reference a variable value within in a String?
# Bonus (5 points). Explain what it means to be statically typed?
