# Code blocks are chunks of code between either curly braces or a do-end
# {puts 'Hiya there kiddo!'}

# their own. They must be passed to other methods or returned by methods.
3.times {puts 'Hiya there kiddo!'}

# This is how you pass a do-end code block to a method.

# Do-end is used for multi-line code blocks.
